**BossShopConfigureX** created by Felix Neubauer (Black_ixx)

== What is it ? ==
BossShopConfigureX is a powerful tool that makes setting up BossShop shops and configurations way easier and faster.
BossShop Bukkit page: dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/bossshop/


== How to use? ==
In order to start the tool just launch "BossShopConfigureXLauncher.jar" with Java. 
The Launcher has been tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10. 


== What to do if the launcher does not work? ==
If it does not work for you perform following steps:
1. Copy your recent craftbukkit.jar/bukkit.jar/spigot.jar file into the "BossShopConfigureX_lib" folder
2. Rename the file into "bukkit.jar"
3. Directly launch "BossShopConfigureX.jar" with Java

== Still not working? ==
If you followed the previous steps and the tool is still not working there probably is an error somewhere. 
If you are using Windows you can find out the error message following way:
1. Create a "<any name>.bat" (Batch) file which contains following command: "java -jar BossShopConfigureX.jar"
2. Put the Batch file into your BossShopConfigureX_beta folder
3. Launch the Batch file (If your Java system path is set up correctly the file will launch BossShopConfigureX.jar and a console displaying information)
4. Try to load your shops with the tool
5. Check for error messages in the console window. If you find any, simply send them to me per PM (https://www.spigotmc.org/members/blackixx.649/)


NOTE: PaperSpigot/Cauldron is not supported yet. If your server uses PaperSpigot/Cauldron that's fine,
However in order to edit your shops with this program you need to select a valid spigot.jar/craftbukkit.jar/bukkit.jar.
You can get a spigot.jar using BuildTools: https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/buildtools/




You don't have your BossShop folder on your computer?
Well then either edit the config files the classic and boring/hard way OR download your "BossShop" Folder, edit it and when you are finished upload it back to your server.
